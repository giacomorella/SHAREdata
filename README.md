## Definitions of variables to construct ##

*Household or family*:

*Income*:

*Marketable wealth*: the value of a familyâ€™s easily tradable assets (namely, home equity, other real estate, financial securities, bank deposits, defined contribution wealth, and business equity) minus its nonmortgage debt (including credit card debt, vehicle loans, and student loans). Home equity is value of main residence less outstanding mortgage on main residence.
